function H = opt_sdp( tol, max_iter, sys_param, runParam, costParam)
%OPT_SDP Run stochastic dynamic programming.
%
%  H = OPT_SDP( tol, max_iter  ) calculate the optimal Bellman value
%  function H usign stochatic dynamic programming (SDP). In SDP method, the
%  external disturbance is stochastic and can be described by a certain
%  probability density function (pdf). The Bellman value function is
%  calculated as : 
% 
%     H(x) = min E[G(x, u, e) + gamma*H(x1)]
%
% where the new value function H(x) is updated as the optimal expected sum
% of immediate cost G(x,u,e) and discounted future value gamma*H(x1). x, u,
% e, and x1 correspond to the current state, decision variable, external
% stochastic disturbance and the next state, respectively. H(x) will be
% updated repeatly until maximum iteration 'max_iter' or accuracy level
% 'tol' is reached.
%
% Output:
%       H - optimal value function.
%
% Input:
%        tol - tolerence value for termination test.
%   max_iter - maximal iteration of Bellman value evaluations.
